## Overview

<!-- GitHub-Finder is a Dockerized full stack MERN app built using `docker-dompose` and `Nginx` to leverage the `GitHub API` and returns Github user profiles, including their most recent repositories, followers, following, public gist, and location. Design, functionality, usability and intergration of containers and proxies were the main focus. -->

DMI is currently in beta. The app will allow users (students) to create their own learning curriculum revision and follow the recommended learning path to enhance their breath & depth of GCSE Higher Level maths. Students have access to an accompanying booklet with every question from every topic covered and a video walk-through.
Students can track progress, share it with friends and make changes as they go along - British Curriculum Examining Body Checklist: Edexcel AQA OCR (subtle differences that topics covered/not covered in each examining board - if students are short on time, they can rest assured they don‚Äôt have to go through that topic as the examining board doesn‚Äôt cover it.)

- Carefully crafted and sequenced curriculum, which runs through the academic year, offering a comprehensive program of study.
- UK-qualified and experienced Maths teachers from Russell Group universities, with a proven track record in leading UK and Dubai schools.
- Effective pedagogical practices and a whole class approach, focused on developing Mathematical thinking.
- We value quality over quantity, which is why we only teach the British Curriculum Mathematics courses, geared towards students in years 10 - 13.
- A web learning platform that works hand in glove with the content taught.

Full design work can be found on behance.
